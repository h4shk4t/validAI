The LensAPI Oracle connects your smart contract to Lens, one of the most popular Web3 social graphs. It supports customized GraphQL queries to Lens API and allows you to easily process the response data to make them digestible to your smart contract.

### Features and Benefits

* Wide support for consumer smart contracts on all mainstream blockchains
* **Verifiable and decentralized**: your Oracle is running on decentralized infrastructure that require no operations and can be easily verified
* **Support private data**: your Oracle state is protected by cryptography and hardware
* **No extra cost**: the only cost is the gas fee of response data which is sent as a transaction
* **High frequency**: the request is synced to Oracle within one minute, and the latency of response is only limited by blockchainâ€™s block interval
