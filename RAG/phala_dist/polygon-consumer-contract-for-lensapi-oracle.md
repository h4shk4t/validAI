# üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Polygon Consumer Contract for LensAPI Oracle

## Overview

This project represents a basic Polygon Consumer Contract that is compatible with a deployed LensAPI Oracle via [Phat Contract 2.0 UI](https://bricks.phala.network). This tutorial assumes the developer is familiar with executing commands in a terminal.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Prerequisites

* Active deployed LensAPI Oracle Blueprint via [Phala Dashboard](https://dashboard.phala.network)
* Address of the "[Oracle Endpoint](https://docs.phala.network/developers/bricks-and-blueprints/featured-blueprints/lensapi-oracle#step-3-connect-your-smart-contract-to-the-oracle)" in deployed LensAPI Oracle
* [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org)
* For Polygon Mainnet deployments:
  * Polygonscan API Key that can be generated on [polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com)
* RPC Endpoint for Polygon Mainnet & Mumbai Testnet
  * [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) - This repo example uses Alchemy's API Key.
  * [Infura](https://infura.io)
  * Personal RPC Node
* Test Tokens at [Phala Faucet](https://bit.ly/3Tomopi)

### Environment Variables: <a href="#user-content-environment-variables" id="user-content-environment-variables"></a>

Check out the environment variables here in [.env.local](https://github.com/Phala-Network/lensapi-oracle-consumer-contract/blob/refactor/.env.local) file.

## Getting Started <a href="#user-content-getting-started" id="user-content-getting-started"></a>

> Note: If you cloned this repo or created a template, skip to [Create a Phala Profile](https://github.com/Phala-Network/lensapi-oracle-consumer-contract/blob/refactor/LENSAPI\_ORACLE.md#create-a-bricks-profile)

First you will need to install the `@phala/fn` CLI tool using your node package manager (`npm`) or use node package execute (`npx`). In this tutorial we use `npx`.

Now create your first template with the CLI tool command:

```sh
npx @phala/fn init example
```

We currently have only one template. Just press enter to see something similar to the example below:

```sh
npx @phala/fn@latest init example
? Please select one of the templates for your "example" project: 
  phat-contract-starter-kit: Send data from any API to your smart contract with Javascript. 
‚ùØ lensapi-oracle-consumer-contract: Send data from Lens API to your smart contract to empower your Web3 Social dApp. 
  vrf-oracle: TEE-guarded Verifiable Random Function template to bring randomness to your smart contract. 
  airstack-phat-contract: Request an account‚Äôs data from Airstack‚Äôs API to compute trust score and send to your Web3 dApp on-chain. 
  thegraph-phat-contract: Connect your subgraphs from The Graph to your on-chain dApps via Phat Contract.  
```

`cd` into the newly created template and `ls` the directory which will look similar to below.

```sh
cd example
ls

### Create a Bricks Profile <a href="#user-content-create-a-bricks-profile" id="user-content-create-a-bricks-profile"></a>

This step requires you to have a Polkadot account. You can get an account from one of the following:

* [Polkadot.js Wallet Extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)
* [Talisman Wallet](https://www.talisman.xyz/)
* [SubWallet](https://www.subwallet.app/) (**Support for iOS/Android**)

First, create your Bricks Profile account on the [Phala PoC6 Testnet](https://bricks-poc5.phala.network/) or [Phala Mainnet](https://bricks.phala.network/). Here is a quick 1 minute [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/z1MR48NYtYc) on setting up from scratch.

Here is what your Bricks Profile account overview should look like:&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Phala-Network/lensapi-oracle-consumer-contract/raw/refactor/assets/BricksProfileCheck.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After creating your Bricks Profile, set your `.env` variable `POLKADOT_WALLET_SURI` to the mnemonic phrase from generating the new Polkadot Account.

Here is a screenshot of how to set `POLKADOT_WALLET_SURI`:&#x20;

Testing Locally
---------------

### Test Default Function Locally <a href="#user-content-test-default-function-locally" id="user-content-test-default-function-locally"></a>

With a template created and a basic default function example ready to test, let‚Äôs step through the process of preparing your repo to execute the test locally.

First step is to install the package dependencies with the following command:

```
npm install
```

Everything should go smoothly and produce similar output below:

```
npm install
# [1/4] üîç  Resolving packages...
# [2/4] üöö  Fetching packages...
# [3/4] üîó  Linking dependencies...
# warning " > @typechain/ethers-v5@10.1.0" has unmet peer dependency "@ethersproject/bytes@^5.0.0".
# [4/4] üî®  Building fresh packages...
# ‚ú®  Done in 4.95s.
```

Now that the package dependencies are installed, lets build the default function which is located in `./src/index.ts`.

// Here is what you need to implemented for Phat Contract, you can customize your logic with

// The Phat Contract will be called with two parameters:

// - request: The raw payload from the contract call `request` (check the `request` function in TestLensApiConsumerConract.sol).
//            In this example, it's a tuple of two elements: [requestId, profileId]
// - secrets: The custom secrets you set with the `config_core` function of the Action Offchain Rollup Phat Contract. In
//            this example, it just a simple text of the lens api url prefix. For more information on secrets, checkout the SECRETS.md file.
//
// Your returns value MUST be a hex string, and it will send to your contract directly. Check the `_onMessageReceived` function in
// OracleConsumerContract.sol for more details. We suggest a tuple of three elements: [successOrNotFlag, requestId, data] as
// the return value.
//
export default function main(request: HexString, secrets: string): HexString {
  console.log(`handle req: ${request}`);
  // Uncomment to debug the `secrets` passed in from the Phat Contract UI configuration.
  // console.log(`secrets: ${secrets}`);
  let requestId, encodedReqStr;
  try {
    [requestId, encodedReqStr] = decodeRequest(decodeRequestAbiParams, request);
    console.log(`[${requestId}]: ${encodedReqStr}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.info("Malformed request received");
    return encodeReply(encodeReplyAbiParams, [BigInt(TYPE_ERROR), 0n, BigInt(errorToCode(error as Error))]);
  }
  console.log(`Request received for profile ${encodedReqStr}`);
  try {
    const respData = fetchApiStats(secrets, encodedReqStr);
    let stats = respData.data.profile.stats.posts;
    console.log("response:", [TYPE_RESPONSE, requestId, stats]);
    return encodeReply(encodeReplyAbiParams, [TYPE_RESPONSE, requestId, stats]);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error === Error.FailedToFetchData) {
      throw error;
    } else {
      // otherwise tell client we cannot process it
      console.log("error:", [TYPE_ERROR, requestId, error]);
      return encodeReply(encodeReplyAbiParams, [TYPE_ERROR, requestId, errorToCode(error as Error)]);
    }
  }
}

```

</details>

Build the default function with this command:

```sh
npx @phala/fn build
```

You will see output similar to the example below. and a file in `./dist/index.js` will be generated.

```sh
npx @phala/fn build
# Creating an optimized build... done
# Compiled successfully.
#
#   17.66 KB  dist/index.js
# ‚ú®  Done in 3.48s.
```

With our default function built, we can run some initial tests. First test will be simple.

```sh
npx @phala/fn run dist/index.js
```

It was expected for it to fail like this:

```sh
npx @phala/fn run dist/index.js
# handle req: undefined
# Malformed request received
# {"output":"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"}
# ‚ú®  Done in 0.96s.
```

Notice that the test fails and reports that a `Malformed request received` was emitted and the request was `undefined`. This is expected as you will need to define the parameters by adding a `-a abi.encode(requestId, profileId) https://api-v2-mumbai-live.lens.dev` to your command.

To simulate the expected result locally, run the Phala Oracle function now with this command:

> Go to [https://playground.ethers.org](https://playground.ethers.org) to `decode` and `encode` the hexstring you want to pass into your Phat Contract `main` function.
>
> In this example, the hexstring  `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000043078303100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` represents types `uint id` and `string reqData`

We have now successfully tested the default function and ran a test to verify the function returns a response as expected.

### Testing Default Function with Local Hardhat Node <a href="#user-content-testing-default-function-with-local-hardhat-node" id="user-content-testing-default-function-with-local-hardhat-node"></a>

Previously we showed how to test the default function locally without a running node, but we can also run two other tests.

1. Run the default mocha e2e tests.
2. Run local hardhat node and watch the requests that are pushed and see how the function transforms the data.

### **Run the default mocha e2e tests**

Lets‚Äôs start with the first test case.

> Note: You will need to ensure you configure your local vars `POLYGON_RPC_URL` and `MUMBAI_RPC_URL` `.env` file. You can do this with `cp .env.local .env` then edit the `.env` with your information.

<details>

<summary>Expected error if <code>.env</code> not configured.</summary>

```sh
npm run localhost-test
# Error HH8: There's one or more errors in your config file:

#  * Invalid value undefined for HardhatConfig.networks.polygon.url - Expected a value of type string.
#  * Invalid value undefined for HardhatConfig.networks.mumbai.url - Expected a value of type string.
  
# To learn more about Hardhat's configuration, please go to https://hardhat.org/config/

# For more info go to https://hardhat.org/HH8 or run Hardhat with --show-stack-traces
# error Command failed with exit code 1.
```

</details>

```sh
npm run localhost-test
```

You will now see that all test cases have passed.

```sh
npm run localhost-test
# Compiled 14 Solidity files successfully
#
#  TestLensApiConsumerContract
#    ‚úî Push and receive message (1664ms)
#
#  1 passing (2s)
#
# ‚ú®  Done in 3.29s.
```

This is how the e2e mocha test will look like. You can customize this file at `./test/TestLensApiConsumerContract.ts`.

<details>

<summary>View file <code>TestLensApiConsumerContract.ts</code></summary>

```typescript
import { expect } from "chai";
import { type Contract, type Event } from "ethers";
import { ethers } from "hardhat";
import { execSync } from "child_process";

async function waitForResponse(consumer: Contract, event: Event) {
  const [, data] = event.args!;
  // Run Phat Function
  const result = execSync(`phat-fn run --json dist/index.js -a ${data} https://api-mumbai.lens.dev/`).toString();
  const json = JSON.parse(result);
  const action = ethers.utils.hexlify(ethers.utils.concat([
    new Uint8Array([0]),
    json.output,
  ]));
  // Make a response
  const tx = await consumer.rollupU256CondEq(
    // cond

    [action],
  );
  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  return receipt.events;
}

describe("TestLensApiConsumerContract", function () {
  it("Push and receive message", async function () {
    // Deploy the contract
    const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
    const TestLensApiConsumerContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("TestLensApiConsumerContract");
    const consumer = await TestLensApiConsumerContract.deploy(deployer.address);

    // Make a request
    const profileId = "0x01";
    const tx = await consumer.request(profileId);
    const receipt = await tx.wait();
    const reqEvents = receipt.events;
    expect(reqEvents![0]).to.have.property("event", "MessageQueued");

    // Wait for Phat Function response
    const respEvents = await waitForResponse(consumer, reqEvents![0])

    // Check response data
    expect(respEvents[0]).to.have.property("event", "ResponseReceived");
    const [reqId, input, value] = respEvents[0].args;
    expect(ethers.BigNumber.isBigNumber(reqId)).to.be.true;
    expect(input).to.equal(profileId);
    expect(ethers.BigNumber.isBigNumber(value)).to.be.true;
  });
});
```

</details>

**Run local hardhat node and watch the requests that are pushed and see how the function transforms the data**

First we will start a local hardhat node.

```
npm run localhost-node
```

<details>

<summary>Example output</summary>

```sh
npm run localhost-node
# Started HTTP and WebSocket JSON-RPC server at http://127.0.0.1:8545/

# Accounts
# ========

# WARNING: These accounts, and their private keys, are publicly known.
# Any funds sent to them on Mainnet or any other live network WILL BE LOST.
```

</details>

With our hardhat node running locally, we can now deploy the `LensApiConsumerContract.sol` contract to the local hardhat network.

```sh
npm run localhost-deploy 
```

```sh
npm run localhost-deploy
# Deploying...
# Deployed { consumer: '0x0165878A594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242Eb8F' }
# ‚ú®  Done in 0.94s.
```

Make sure to copy the deployed contract address when you deploy your own contract locally. Note you contract address will be different than `0x0165878A594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242Eb8F`. We will now start watching the hardhat node deployed contract for any new requests.

```sh
npx @phala/fn watch 0x0165878A594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242Eb8F artifacts/contracts/TestLensApiConsumerContract.sol/TestLensApiConsumerContract.json dist/index.js -a https://api-mumbai.lens.dev/
```

```sh
npx @phala/fn watch 0x0165878A594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242Eb8F artifacts/contracts/TestLensApiConsumerContract.sol/TestLensApiConsumerContract.json dist/index.js -a https://api-v2-mumbai-live.lens.dev/

# Listening for TestLensApiConsumerContract MessageQueued events...
```

Let‚Äôs now make a new request and see what happens with the listener‚Äôs output. In separate tab, you will push a request with the following.

```sh
LOCALHOST_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x0165878A594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242Eb8F npm run localhost-push-request
```

```sh
LOCALHOST_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x0165878A594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242Eb8F npm run localhost-push-request
# Pushing a request...
# Received event [ResponseReceived]: {
#  reqId: BigNumber { value: "1" },
#  input: '0x01',
#  value: BigNumber { value: "3361" }
# }
# ‚ú®  Done in 4.99s.
```

If we look back at the listener tab, we will see output has been appended.

```sh
Listening for TestLensApiConsumerContract MessageQueued events...

  tail: 0n,
  data: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000043078303100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'

```

## Deployment

Now that you have the prerequisites to deploy a Polygon Consumer Contract on Polygon, lets begin with some initials tasks.

### Install Dependencies & Compile Contracts

```shell
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# compile contracts
$ npm run compile
```

### &#x20;Deploy to Polygon Mumbai Testnet <a href="#user-content-deploy-to-polygon-mumbai-testnet" id="user-content-deploy-to-polygon-mumbai-testnet"></a>

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important**

This guide references the `mumbai` testnet chain.&#x20;

The`mumbai` testnet is [deprecated since 2024/04/08](https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-the-amoy-testnet-for-polygon-pos), meaning the steps to deploy to a testnet will no longer work out of the box.

You can opt to use the [`amoy`](https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-the-amoy-testnet-for-polygon-pos) testnet or any other EVM testnet instead.
{% endhint %}

With the contracts successfully compiled, now we can begin deploying first to Polygon Mumbai Testnet. If you have not gotten `MATIC` for Mumbai Testnet then get `MATIC` from a [faucet](https://mumbaifaucet.com/). Ensure to save the address after deploying the Consumer Contract because this address will be use in the "[Configure Client](https://docs.phala.network/developers/bricks-and-blueprints/featured-blueprints/lensapi-oracle#step-4-configure-the-client-address)" section of Phat Bricks UI. The deployed address will also be set to the environment variable [`MUMBAI_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`](https://github.com/Phala-Network/lensapi-oracle-consumer-contract/blob/refactor/.env.local).

```sh
npm run test-deploy
```

```sh
# deploy contracts to testnet mumbai
npm run test-deploy
# Deploying...
#
# üéâ Your Consumer Contract has been deployed, check it out here: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x10FA409109E073C15b77A8352cB6A89C12CD1605
#
# You also need to set up the consumer contract address in your .env file:
#
# MUMBAI_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x10FA409109E073C15b77A8352cB6A89C12CD1605
#
# Configuring...
# Done
# ‚ú®  Done in 8.20s.
```

### **(Optional) Verify Contract on Polygon Mumbai Testnet**

Ensure to update the [`mumbai.arguments.ts`](https://github.com/Phala-Network/lensapi-oracle-consumer-contract/blob/refactor/mumbai.arguments.ts) file with the constructor arguments used to instantiate the Consumer Contract. If you add additional parameters to the constructor function then make sure to update the `mumbai.arguments.ts` file.

> **Note**: Your contract address will be different than `0x090E8fDC571d65459569BC87992C1026121DB955` when verifying your contract. Make sure to get your actual contract address from the console log output after executing `npm run test-deploy`.

```sh
npm run test-verify -- <MUMBAI_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

```sh
npm run test-verify -- 0x090E8fDC571d65459569BC87992C1026121DB955
# $ hardhat verify --network mumbai --constructor-args mumbai.arguments.ts 0x090E8fDC571d65459569BC87992C1026121DB955
