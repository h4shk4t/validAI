# ‚öîÔ∏è Connect Phat Contract to EVM Consumer Contract

## Overview <a href="#user-content-overview" id="user-content-overview"></a>

This project represents a basic EVM Consumer Contract that is compatible with a deployed Oracle written in TypeScript on Phala Network.

> **Note**: For simplicity, we will utilize Polygon Mumbai and Polygon Mainnet for the following examples.

## Prerequisites <a href="#user-content-prerequisites" id="user-content-prerequisites"></a>

* Active Phala Profile with version `>= 1.0.1` via [Phala Dashboard](https://bit.ly/3LHccmR)
* [Hardhat](https://bit.ly/469uyW5)
* For EVM Mainnet deployments:
  * Ex: Polygonscan API Key that can be generated on [polygonscan](https://bit.ly/3rBkypp)
* RPC Endpoint for EVM Chain Mainnet & EVM Chain Testnet
  * [Alchemy](https://bit.ly/46uObaH) - This repo example uses Alchemy's API Key.
  * [Infura](https://bit.ly/3PXXCtN)
  * Personal RPC Node (Ex. [ProjectPi](https://bit.ly/3RGf7QS))
* Polkadot Account for Phala PoC6 Testnet and Mainnet deployment
  * [Phala Faucet](https://bit.ly/3Tomopi)
* Node >= 18.x

## Getting Started <a href="#user-content-getting-started" id="user-content-getting-started"></a>

> üö® **Note** üö®:
>
> If you cloned this repo or created a template, skip to [Create a Phala Profile](connect-phat-contract-to-evm-consumer-contract.md#user-content-create-a-phala-profile).

First you will need to install the `@phala/fn` CLI tool using your node package manager (`npm`) or use node package execute (`npx`). In this tutorial we use `npx`.

Now create your first template with the CLI tool command:

```sh
npx @phala/fn@latest init userJourney
```

Select one of the template and press enter to see something similar to the example below:

```sh
npx @phala/fn@latest init userJourney
? Please select one of the templates for your "userJourney" project: 
‚ùØ phat-contract-starter-kit: Send data from any API to your smart contract with Javascript. 
  lensapi-oracle-consumer-contract: Send data from Lens API to your smart contract to empower your Web3 Social dApp. 
  vrf-oracle: TEE-guarded Verifiable Random Function template to bring randomness to your smart contract. 
  airstack-phat-contract: Request an account‚Äôs data from Airstack‚Äôs API to compute trust score and send to your Web3 dApp on-chain. 
  thegraph-phat-contract: Connect your subgraphs from The Graph to your on-chain dApps via Phat Contract.  
```

`cd` into the newly created template and `ls` the directory which will look similar to below.

```sh
cd userJourney
ls

## Create a Phala Profile <a href="#user-content-create-a-phala-profile" id="user-content-create-a-phala-profile"></a>

This step requires you to have a Polkadot account. You can get an account from one of the following:

* [Polkadot.js Wallet Extension](https://bit.ly/3RMUjqy)
* [Talisman Wallet](https://bit.ly/3ZzAPYD)
* [SubWallet](https://bit.ly/3tjS8R7) (**Support for iOS/Android**)

First, create your Phala Profile account on the [Phala Dashboard](https://bit.ly/3LHccmR). Here is a quick 1 minute [YouTube video](https://bit.ly/46clfo4) on setting up from scratch. Here is what your Phala Profile account overview should look like:

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Phala-Network/phat-contract-starter-kit/raw/main/assets/BricksProfileCheck.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Option 1: Export Polkadot account as json file**

Go to your browser and click on the polkadot.js extension. Select your account and click "Export Account". Next, you will be prompted for your password before saving the file to your project directory. **Note** this is what will be set to `POLKADOT_WALLET_ACCOUNT_PASSPHRASE`. Make sure to save the file as `polkadot-account.json` in the root of your project directory.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Phala-Network/phat-contract-starter-kit/raw/main/assets/SaveAccount.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Option 2: Set mnemonic phrase to `POLKADOT_WALLET_SURI`**

After creating your Phala Profile, set your `.env` variable `POLKADOT_WALLET_SURI` to the mnemonic phrase from generating the new Polkadot Account.

Here is a screenshot of how to set `POLKADOT_WALLET_SURI`:

## Testing Locally <a href="#user-content-testing-locally" id="user-content-testing-locally"></a>

#### Test Default Phat Contract Locally <a href="#user-content-test-default-phat-contract-locally" id="user-content-test-default-phat-contract-locally"></a>

With a template created and a basic default Phat Contract example ready to test, let‚Äôs step through the process of preparing your repo to execute the test locally.

First step is to install the package dependencies with the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

Everything should go smoothly and produce similar output below:

```
npm install
# [1/4] üîç  Resolving packages...
# [2/4] üöö  Fetching packages...
# [3/4] üîó  Linking dependencies...
# warning " > @typechain/ethers-v5@10.1.0" has unmet peer dependency "@ethersproject/bytes@^5.0.0".
# [4/4] üî®  Building fresh packages...
# ‚ú®  Done in 4.95s.
```

Now that the package dependencies are installed, lets build the default Phat Contract which is located in [`./src/index.ts`](https://bit.ly/3PBnP02).

For those want to understand what the contents of `./src/index.ts` mean, go [here](customizing-your-phat-contract.md) read more. If you are already familiar with the concepts then you can proceed to with the deployment process.

Build the default Phat Contract with this command:

```bash
npx @phala/fn build
```

You will see output similar to the example below. and a file in `./dist/index.js` will be generated.

```bash
npx @phala/fn build
# ‚úì Compiled successfully.
#   17.66 KB  dist/index.js
```

With our default Phat Contract built, we can run some initial tests. First test will be simple.

```bash
npx @phala/fn run dist/index.js
```

It was expected for it to fail like this:

```bash
npx @phala/fn run dist/index.js
# handle req: undefined
# Malformed request received
# {"output":"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"}
# ‚ú®  Done in 0.96s.
```

Notice that the test fails and reports that a `Malformed request received` was emitted and the request was `undefined`. This is expected as you will need to define the parameters by adding a `-a abi.encode(requestId, profileId) https://api-v2-mumbai-live.lens.dev` to your command.

To simulate the expected result locally, run the Phala Oracle function now with this command:

```bash
npx @phala/fn run dist/index.js -a 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000043078303100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 https://api-v2-mumbai-live.lens.dev
```

> **What are the ingredients for the `npx @phala/fn run` command?**
>
> Our Phat Contract script, now fully constructed, is ready for a trial run. This simulation mirrors the live script's operation when deployed on the Phala Network.
>
> The command's first parameter is a HexString, representing a tuple of types `[uint, bytes]`. This serves as the entry function. The second parameter is a `string`, embodying the configurable secrets fed into the main function.
>
> The `Coders.decode` function deciphers these parameters, yielding the decoded `requestId` and `encodedReqStr`. These decoded elements then become the raw material for the rest of the custom logic within the script.
>
> ```typescript
> export default function main(request: HexString, settings: string): HexString {
>   console.log(`handle req: ${request}`);
>   let requestId, encodedReqStr;
>   try {
>     [requestId, encodedReqStr] = decodeRequest(decodeRequestAbiParams, request);
>   } catch (error) {
>     console.info("Malformed request received");
>   }
> // ...
> } 
> ```

```

We have now successfully tested the default Phat Contract and ran a test to verify the function returns a response as expected.

### Testing Default Phat Contract with Local Hardhat Node <a href="#user-content-testing-default-phat-contract-with-local-hardhat-node" id="user-content-testing-default-phat-contract-with-local-hardhat-node"></a>

Previously we showed how to test the default Phat Contract locally without a running node, but we can also run two other tests.

1. Run the default mocha e2e tests.
2. Run local hardhat node and watch the requests that are pushed and see how the Phat Contract transforms the data.

**Run the default mocha e2e tests**

Lets‚Äôs start with the first test case.

> Note: You will need to ensure you configure your local vars `POLYGON_RPC_URL` and `MUMBAI_RPC_URL` `.env` file. You can do this with `cp .env.local .env` then edit the `.env` with your information.

```sh
npm run localhost-test
```

You will now see that all test cases have passed.

```sh
npm run localhost-test
# Compiled 14 Solidity files successfully
#
#  OracleConsumerContract.sol
#    ‚úî Push and receive message (1664ms)
#
#  1 passing (2s)
#
# ‚ú®  Done in 3.29s.
```

This is how the e2e mocha test will look like. You can customize this file at `OracleConsumerContract.ts`.

**Run local hardhat node and watch the requests that are pushed and see how the Phat Contract transforms the data**

First we will start a local hardhat node.

```sh
npm run localhost-node
```

With our hardhat node running locally, we can now deploy the `OracleConsumerContract.sol` contract to the local hardhat network.

<pre class="language-sh"><code class="lang-sh"><strong>npm run localhost-deploy 
</strong></code></pre>

```sh
npm run localhost-deploy
# Deploying...
# Deployed { consumer: '0x0165878A594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242Eb8F' }
# ‚ú®  Done in 0.94s.
```

Make sure to copy the deployed contract address when you deploy your own contract locally. Note you contract address will be different than `0x0165878A594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242Eb8F`. We will now start watching the hardhat node deployed contract for any new requests.

```sh
npx @phala/fn watch 0x0165878A594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242Eb8F artifacts/contracts/OracleConsumerContract.sol/OracleConsumerContract.json dist/index.js -a https://api-mumbai.lens.dev/
```

```sh
npx @phala/fn watch 0x0165878A594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242Eb8F artifacts/contracts/OracleConsumerContract.sol/OracleConsumerContract.json dist/index.js -a https://api-mumbai.lens.dev/
# Listening for OracleConsumerContract.sol MessageQueued events...
```

Let‚Äôs now make a new request and see what happens with the listener‚Äôs output. In separate tab, you will push a request with the following.

```sh
LOCALHOST_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x0165878A594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242Eb8F npm run localhost-push-request
```

```sh
LOCALHOST_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x0165878A594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242Eb8F npm run localhost-push-request
# Pushing a request...
# Received event [ResponseReceived]: {
#  reqId: BigNumber { value: "1" },
#  input: '0x01',
#  value: BigNumber { value: "1597" }
# }
# ‚ú®  Done in 4.99s.
```

If we look back at the listener tab, we will see output has been appended.

```sh
Listening for OracleConsumerContract MessageQueued events...
Received event [MessageQueued]: {
  tail: 0n,
  data: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000043078303100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
}

```

## Deployment <a href="#user-content-deployment" id="user-content-deployment"></a>

Now that you have the prerequisites to deploy a Polygon Consumer Contract on Polygon, lets begin with some initials tasks.

### Install Dependencies & Compile Contracts <a href="#user-content-install-dependencies--compile-contracts" id="user-content-install-dependencies--compile-contracts"></a>

```sh
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# compile contracts
$ npm run compile
```

### Deploy to Polygon Mumbai Testnet <a href="#user-content-deploy-to-polygon-mumbai-testnet" id="user-content-deploy-to-polygon-mumbai-testnet"></a>

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important**

This guide references the `mumbai` testnet chain.&#x20;

The`mumbai` testnet is [deprecated since 2024/04/08](https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-the-amoy-testnet-for-polygon-pos), meaning the steps to deploy to a testnet will no longer work out of the box.

You can opt to use the [`amoy`](https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-the-amoy-testnet-for-polygon-pos) testnet or any other EVM testnet instead.
{% endhint %}

With the contracts successfully compiled, now we can begin deploying first to Polygon Mumbai Testnet. If you have not gotten `MATIC` for Mumbai Testnet then get `MATIC` from a [faucet](https://bit.ly/3ZyFoT3). Ensure to save the address after deploying the Consumer Contract because this address will be use in the "Configure Client" section of Phat Bricks UI. The deployed address will also be set to the environment variable `MUMBAI_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.

<pre class="language-sh"><code class="lang-sh"><strong>npm run test-deploy
</strong></code></pre>

```sh
# deploy contracts to testnet mumbai
npm run test-deploy
# Deploying...
#
# üéâ Your Consumer Contract has been deployed, check it out here: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x10FA409109E073C15b77A8352cB6A89C12CD1605
#
# You also need to set up the consumer contract address in your .env file:
#
# MUMBAI_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x10FA409109E073C15b77A8352cB6A89C12CD1605
#
# Configuring...
# Done
# ‚ú®  Done in 8.20s.
```

### **(Optional) Verify Contract on Polygon Mumbai Testnet**

Ensure to update the `mumbai.arguments.ts` file with the constructor arguments used to instantiate the Consumer Contract. If you add additional parameters to the constructor function then make sure to update the `mumbai.arguments.ts` file.

> **Note**: Your contract address will be different than `0x090E8fDC571d65459569BC87992C1026121DB955` when verifying your contract. Make sure to get your actual contract address from the console log output after executing `npm run test-deploy`.

```sh
npm run test-verify -- <MUMBAI_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

```sh
npm run test-verify -- 0x090E8fDC571d65459569BC87992C1026121DB955
# $ hardhat verify --network mumbai --constructor-args mumbai.arguments.ts 0x090E8fDC571d65459569BC87992C1026121DB955

```

### Deploy Phat Contract to PoC6 Testnet <a href="#user-content-deploy-phat-contract-to-poc5-testnet" id="user-content-deploy-phat-contract-to-poc5-testnet"></a>

For customizing your Phat Contract, checkout Phat Contract custom configurations in [Customizing Your Phat Contract](customizing-your-phat-contract.md) to learn more before deploying to PoC6 testnet.

Now that are Phat Contract has built successfully, let's deploy to Phala PoC6 Testnet with the following command:

```shell

Congrats! You've now successfully updated your Phat Contract!

### Deploy to Polygon Mainnet <a href="#user-content-deploy-to-polygon-mainnet" id="user-content-deploy-to-polygon-mainnet"></a>

Ensure to save the address after deploying the Consumer Contract because this address will be used in the "[Configure Client](https://docs.phala.network/developers/bricks-and-blueprints/featured-blueprints/lensapi-oracle#step-4-configure-the-client-address)" section of Phat Bricks UI. The deployed address will also be set to the environment variable `POLYGON_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.

> **Note**: Your contract address will be different than `0xbb0d733BDBe151dae3cEf8D7D63cBF74cCbf04C4` when verifying your contract. Make sure to get your actual contract address from the console log output after executing `npm run main-deploy`.

```sh
npm run main-deploy
# Deploying...
#
# üéâ Your Consumer Contract has been deployed, check it out here: https://polygonscan.com/address/0xbb0d733BDBe151dae3cEf8D7D63cBF74cCbf04C4
#
# You also need to set up the consumer contract address in your .env file:
#
# POLYGON_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xbb0d733BDBe151dae3cEf8D7D63cBF74cCbf04C4
#
# Configuring...
# Done
# ‚ú®  Done in 8.20s.
```

### **(Optional) Verify Contract on Polygon Mainnet**

Ensure to update the `polygon.arguments.ts` file with the constructor arguments used to instantiate the Consumer Contract. If you add additional parameters to the constructor function then make sure to update the `polygon.arguments.ts` file.

```sh
npm run main-verify -- 0xbb0d733BDBe151dae3cEf8D7D63cBF74cCbf04C4
# Nothing to compile
# No need to generate any newer typings.
# Successfully submitted source code for contract
