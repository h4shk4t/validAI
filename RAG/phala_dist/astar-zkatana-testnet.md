# Astar zKatana Testnet

Astar zkEVM is a zero-knowledge scaling solution for Ethereum that offers an EVM-equivalent environment on which existing EVM smart contracts, developer tools, and wallets can work seamlessly. Astar zkEVM harnesses the power of zero-knowledge proofs to reduce transaction costs and increase throughput, while inheriting the security of Ethereum.
