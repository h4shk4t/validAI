# Generate Test Account

To deploy your contract to any testnet, you will first need to

* generate your own test account;
* transfer some test tokens to it to ensure you can pay for the deployment transaction fee.

In the following tutorial, we use the [Polkadot.js extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) as the default wallet. Other wallets are available here.
